# BattleTracker

BattleTracker is meant for getting alerts in Discord when a person in the tracking list joins one of your Battlefield 4 servers.

## TODO
- [ ] Write a better README and do some documentation :D
- [ ] Support for "unlimited" tracking list. Currently only one embed is printed and is limited to as many fields as embed supports.
- [ ] Handle webhook rate limits. Most likely won't affect the tracking list itself but if join/leave messages are enabled for everyone simultaneously on multiple servers, they most likely will.
